# Invariant Information Clustering (IIC) for Human Activity Recognition (HAR)

This repository hosts the code and resources for adapting **Invariant Information Clustering (IIC)** to the challenging domain of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using image data. The project investigates the performance of unsupervised learning on a dataset of still images containing 15 human activities.

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview

Human activity recognition has traditionally relied on supervised learning, but unsupervised methods like **IIC** provide an alternative that avoids costly labeling. This project explores IICâ€™s potential for clustering human activities in still images, building on previous works that use mutual information to learn invariant representations.

Key features:
- **Dataset**: Still images representing 15 human activities (e.g., drinking, using a laptop) in various environments. 
- **Preprocessing**: Data augmentation and pair generation to improve diversity and cluster stability.
- **Model**: ResNet18-based architecture with overclustering techniques to handle noise and class overlap.
- **Experiments**: Comparison of unsupervised IIC results with supervised models, highlighting the challenges of unsupervised HAR.
